# Constructor-Word-Guess
This is a Node Word Guess command-line game that use constructor functions that are required from different files. The user is presented with an array of words, one word at a time, where the letters are hidden. In this game all of the words are car makes (ex. Lexus, Toyota, Acura). The user is allowed to guess one letter at a time. They are only allowed 7 incorrect guesses per word. Once they run out of guesses then the game is over. The user wins the game once they have successfully guessed all the words.

## Game Play
At the beginning of the game the user is presented with a prompt explaining the game, and if they would like to play. If they decide to play, they are presented with the first word to guess.
